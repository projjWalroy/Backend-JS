console.log("Hello, World"); // ";" is not mandatory
 
/* Null, Undefined, boolean, string, number, symbol -> primitive data types

Objects stores {"key": value} pair

"typeof" returns type of the value but the answer we get in string.

typeof "null" is object-> corner case
typeof undefined is undefined
type of "NaN" is number
console.log() print in new line and "," separated includes space inbetween
But only in node.

process.stdout.write("") -> print in same line

Program in a running state called process

types of varible - > let, var, const | this are keywords

typeof(typeof(12)) -> string

if we want to have floor divison then
1-> parseInt(5/2)
2-> Math.floor(5/2)

Function-->

function <name>{

    return statement/ return undefined;
}

console.log() is also a function, and its return type undefined. thats why its prints undefined after printing
console.log() defined internally.

"!==" strictly not equal "!=" abstract not equal
"===" strictly equal     "==" abstract equall

"+" -> concatinate two strings and return new one
